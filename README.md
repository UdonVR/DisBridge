## Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x
I want to prefix this with: if you need help, DM me via Discord, I'll help anyone through the upgrade process!!

Upgrading should be easy, first and foremost: **MAKE A BACKUP**
Nothing should break, but you should always keep backups, if you haven't already, I've written a guide on how to put your projects onto GitHub in the #tutorials forum in our Discord server

**MAKE SURE YOU'RE ON SDK 3.1.11 OR GREATER, preferably the latest SDK**

Delete your `/Assets/_UdonVR/DisBridge` folder **DO NOT DELETE ANYTHING IN YOUR SCENE**
Import the new package, everything should re-find their refences, and you should be 90% there

From here, you can do 1 of 2 things, you can re-import your JSON again, which will include all of the new information, or you can run `/Guild-Status` and add in your new  URL *(the key is the same)* and your role IDs into the Plugin manager if you don't wish to re setup your roles.
