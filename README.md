## What is DisBridge
DisBridge is a service that essentially links your Discord Server to your VRChat world.
*<br>To put some more detail to that is, it's a Discord bot that reads users in selected Discord Roles, asks those Users what their VRChat accounts are, keeps track of their usernames, and updates all that information for you automatically in-world with no re-uploading required.*

DisBridge takes 15 minutes to setup and requires 0 programming knowledge.

The purpose for this service is to save you time having to manually keep track of users, manually add them into your world and eliminating the time wasted waiting for your world to build and re-upload for doing these, at times, tiny changes.

We have pre-built plugins for DisBridge supplied to you with DisBridge and a fully documented "API" for creating your own plugins.

If you'd like to know more about this, you can read the Wiki here, read through some of the plugins in this repo or you can come ask us on Discord. You can join the Discord with the button below, or with this link/invite code: [mGAk7nd](http://discord.gg/mGAk7nd)
