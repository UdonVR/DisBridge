# Sign up 
You only need to sign up for one service. KoFi is recommended due to it being more actively supported and has lower platform fees than Patreon.
<br>All new servers to DisBridge get 30 days of the $25 tier. This is to allow you to setup your server without having to wait for your upload time.

*Near Realtime is estimated to be a 5 - 15min delay as long as nothing breaks or hangs. Any users that are in an instance also need to reload/rejoin the instance to receive the changes. Needing to reload/rejoin to receive changes applies to all tiers.*
