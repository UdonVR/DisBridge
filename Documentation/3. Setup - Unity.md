Most of what you need has been made for you with prefabs and put into your Hierarchy's Context menu.
<br>This doc will be going over how to set our prefabs up. If you'd like to make your own plugins for the prefab,
please refer to "Making a Plugin".

# Adding the prefab to your Scene
DisBridge's prefab is in your Hierarchy's Context menu.
<br>What that means is you add them into your Scene as you would any other object.
<br>When you right click to add a new object into your scene, you should see a new option at the bottom on your menu for UdonVR. (That menu is called a Context menu)
<br>Going into that option, you should see a section for DisBridge.
<br>Clicking on the option for DisBridge under that adds the prefab to your scene.
<br>Just to clarify, the Context Menu path for the prefab is `UdonVR/DisBridge/DisBridge`

# Setting up the Prefab
If you are using the free version of DisBridge, you can skip to `Parts of a RoleContainer` below for setup, as you wont have a JSON to import and will need to do a manual setup.

To initially setup the prefab, it is recommended to import your roles from the DisBridge bot.
<br>All you need to do is to click the `Parse from Json` button in the bottom right of the editing tool.
<br><i>(If you dont have the Json file to import, you can get it by running `/guild-status` in your server.)</i>
<br>All of your roles should now be in the editing tool.

After importing your roles, you'll need to do some minor edits.
<br>To edit a role, all you need to do is click on the role, and it should expand to show all the options.
<br>You'll need to go though each of your now imported roles and check mark what roles are and aren't support and staff roles.
<br>The `Is Supporter` and `Is Staff` check marks are for generic checks. This is so if a plugin doesn't need to know what specific role you're in, and just needs to know if you're a staff member or a supporter.
<br>A role can be both a supporter and a staff member. If you're just using DisBridge to edit a list of names, you dont need to mark any roles as supporters or staff. But it's still recommended to do so.

Other notable options would be `Alternative Role Name`, `Role Icon` and `Manual Usernames`.
<br>You can read about what everything does in `Parts of a RoleContainer` below.

# Legacy

## Manually setting up your RoleContainers
manual setup of your role containers is no longer needed in version 8.0+. The recommended way is to use the included editing tool.
<br>This way is still needed for the Legacy version of DisBridge.

Roles are stored in objects called RoleContainers. Your RoleContainers are stored under your DisBrige PluginManager under `-- Roles --`.
<br>There are 3 ways to add a new RoleContainer.
<br>You can duplicate the current RoleContainer which will make a new one next to the current one. Or you can right click `-- Roles --` and add a new RoleContainer found under `/UdonVR/DisBridge/Parts/RoleContainer`.
<br>If you would like to add the prefab manually it's found in `_UdonVR/DisBridge/Prefabs/Parts`

The RoleContainer holds all of your roles information. They MUST be under `-- Roles --` in the PluginManager and in the same order you have your roles setup as in Discord.
*<br>You can find your role order by running `/Guild-status` and can be re-ordered using `/supporter-role reorder`*
